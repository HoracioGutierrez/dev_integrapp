# Integrapp

Integrapp is a web application that allows you to manage orthopedic supplies and equipment. It is built on top of CodeIgniter and MySQL.
This repository is a fork of the original Integrapp repository so that I could add some features to it. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gustavo-m-franco/dev_integrapp).
